# NailVibe
This is our first project as a group. I have setup the basic template , You guys have to make changes in the App.tsx as per your task

## Branch out
For every feature that you work on make a separate branch (do not work in main/master) and create separate components (feature you are working on) that can be embed in the App.tsx . For example - I am working on services , I will create a Service component(file) and then embed the component in the main file.

## Installation guide
To install follow the steps:
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install - this install all the packages
3. work on your feature
4. npm run dev - this will run the development server

## Push guide
Please follow the following steps:
1. After you are done with your feature (assuming you have tested it thoroughly , responsiveness is most important)
2. Commit your work (write a meaningful message)
3. git checkout main - this switch your branch to main
4. git pull 
5. git checkout your-branch
6. git merge origin/main (resolve any conflicts - most of the times just combine both changes)
7. Commit your work again (this is part of step 6 they go together you don't have to commit again)
8. Push your branch (you can use terminal or IDE your choice)
9. Make the Pull request (Make all of us as reviewer)
